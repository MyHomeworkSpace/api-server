Hi {{.User.Name | fname}},<br />
<br />
You're getting this email because you recently graduated from Dalton, and your Dalton account is going away soon. If you'd like to continue using MyHomeworkSpace in college, we've made a new MyHomeworkSpace account for you. (don't worry, all of your data is still there!)<br />
<br />
You can sign in to MyHomeworkSpace, just like you normally would, with the following credentials:<br />
<br />
Email: {{.User.Email}}<br />
Password is the same you'd use for FirstClass, Classes, etc<br />
<br />
Once you've logged in, you can visit the Settings page, where you can change your email address and password. <strong>We recommend doing this as soon as you can&mdash;otherwise, we'll have no way of contacting you!</strong><br />
<br />
If you need any help, or have any questions, you can email us at hello@myhomework.space.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
